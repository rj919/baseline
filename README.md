## Introduction
Baseline is a drone-based platform made for Travelers Group and the [Hartford InsurTech Hub Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hartford-insurtech-hub-hackathon-customer-driven-claims-processing-using-ai-and-robotics-tickets-44926425147) which takes imagery both before & after a property damage claim. When a new policyholder signs up, Baseline dispatches a drone to inspect their property and collect a comprehensive set of images of the exterior of the property from a series of designated waypoints. These images form a baseline for the condition of the house which machine learning algorithms compare with images taken from the exact same waypoints after a claim is made to assess the extent of involvement required by a claims adjuster. A new set of imagery taken upon policy renewals also allow homeowners to receive annual updates on the condition of their property and advice on how to reduce potential threats. 

## Benefit
Baseline will streamline claims and improve underwriting through advanced remote sensing and machine learning.
